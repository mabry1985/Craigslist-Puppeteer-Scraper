You:

You’re more than capable. You’re the one your teammates talk about in hushed tones. “How did he/she DO that?!?” “Is that even possible!?!”

You’re able to make things work when others crumble under the pressure. You’re beyond just being “motivated” or a “self-starter”. We know that when we toss you the keys you’re going to excel and exceed our expectations. Because that’s what you do.

You’re a grown up. You know how to hit your deadlines, and stay in touch when things get tricky. You’re a professional. You don’t need us to babysit you or tie your shoes. You’ll be telecommuting, and you’ll handle that responsibility like a champ.

Oh, and you know how to communicate too. Because it’s better to say “No” right now, than it is to say “Yes” and screw something up six months down the line because you were afraid to speak your truth.

Us: 

We’re the employer you dreamed about while you were in college. Yep, we “get” you. We’ll recognize your wins, and reward you for them. We’ll help coach you past your weak points. We all have them. And we’re okay if you’re able to help us find our weak points too. We’re secretly hoping to find a new best friend and growth partner.

If you’re capable and you have the personality to help us drive this thing forward instead of us having to drag you, we want to have a conversation. Send a resume, and do it quick, before somebody else does.

PS- Let me repeat. PLEASE have a personality. You’ll find us a charming, fun environment to work and grow. If you’re capable, we’ll be your biggest cheerleaders and help drive you to every success. 

PPS- We also need you to have some relevant experience.

Namely:

Proven working experience in technical writing of software documentation

Ability to deliver high quality documentation paying attention to detail

Ability to quickly grasp complex technical concepts and make them easily understandable in text and pictures

Basic familiarity with the SDLC and software development

Standardize documentation for layout, style, and language, and create templates and scripts to automate as possible.

Work with project teams to create documentation for diverse groups.

Track revisions and edits, and maintain files.

Review and improve formatting and visual components, and specifications.

Familiarity with Adobe Design Suite CS6 (Illustrator, InDesign, PhotoShop)

Familiarity with style guides such as AP Stylebook, Chicago Manual of Style, and
Microsoft Manual of Style/Technical Publications 

Ability to work directly with engineering documents – specifications, test plans, diagrams, schematics, and so on.

University degree in Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent preferred
